#INFERENTIAL-STATISTICS
###### (NB. all the material is under copyright of the University of Padua even the projects carried out by me so it is not possible to use them)
Inferential Statistics Course held in university of Padua 21/22
The repository contains all homework, laboratories and Materials done or used during the course, held by [Erlis Ruli](https://homes.stat.unipd.it/erlisruli/).

1. Introduction to statistical inference through practical problems.
2. The statistical model, selection, random sample, random sample, observed sample (the data). Empirical time function and empirical quantiles.
3. The main sample distributions: student t, F, chi-square, and approximate sample distributions by means of the central limit theorem.
4. Parametric statistical models: normal, exponential, gamma and Weibull.
5. Parametric statistical models for discrete data: binomial, negative binomial, Poisson and multinomial.
6. Likelihood function and its use in inferential statistics (estimation, confidence sets and hypothesis testing). Information observed and information expected. Computational aspects.
7. Punctual estimation of parameters and estimators. Methods for the construction of point estimators: method of moments, least squares and maximum likelihood. Properties of estimators: sufficiency, bias, efficiency and exact or asymptotic consistency.
8. Confidence regions, confidence intervals. Methods for constructing confidence regions: exact or approximated confidence regions through pivotal quantities and the likelihood function.
9. Hypothesis testing. Methods for the construction of exact or approximate statistical tests for hypothesis testing: Neyman-Pearson lemma, pivotal quantities and likelihood function. Properties of statistical tests: first type error, second type error, level of significance and power of a test.
10. Practical problems: inference for proportions in one or two samples, inference for a mean or vector of means (analysis of variance), inference on the coefficients of a linear regression, inference for the variance of a normal model, inference for the model multinomial, contingency tables and goodness-of-fit tests. All numerical calculations will be performed with the R software (https://cran.r-project.org).
11. Introduction to statistical inference in the non-parametric field. The bootstrap method.
12. Introduction to Bayesian statistics through practical problems. The a priori distribution and the a posteriori distribution of a parameter. Point and interval Bayesian estimators.
